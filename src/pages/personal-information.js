                Financial companies collect and sometimes share personal
                information to underwrite funding services and prevent
                fraudulent activities on accounts. While Federal law gives
                consumers the right to limit some sharing, these laws don’t
                always extend to business transactions. This notice should help
                you to understand what we do.
